<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<br>

<b>I</b>

<p>This collection of slave narratives had its beginning in the
second year of the former Federal Writers' Project (now the Writers'
Program), 1936, when several state Writers' Projects&mdash;notably
those of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina&mdash;recorded interviews
with ex-slaves residing in those states. On April 22, 1937,
a standard questionnaire for field workers drawn up by John A.
Lomax, then National Advisor on Folklore and Folkways for the Federal
Writers' Project<a name='FNanchor_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1'>[1]</a>,
was issued from Washington as &quot;Supplementary
Instructions #9-E to The American Guide Manual&quot; (appended below).
Also associated with the direction and criticism of the
work in the Washington office of the Federal Writers' Project
were Henry G. Alsberg, Director; George Cronyn, Associate Director;
Sterling A. Brown, Editor on Negro Affairs; Mary Lloyd, Editor;
and B.A. Botkin, Folklore Editor succeeding Mr.
Lomax.<a name='FNanchor_2'></a><a href='#Footnote_2'>[2]</a></p>

<a name='Footnote_1'></a><a href='#FNanchor_1'>[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.
Lomax served from June 25, 1936, to October 23, 1937, with
a ninety-day furlough beginning July 24, 1937. According to a
memorandum written by Mr. Alsberg on March 23, 1937, Mr. Lomax was
&quot;in charge of the collection of folklore all over the United States
for the Writers' Project. In connection with this work he is making
recordings of Negro songs and cowboy ballads. Though technically
on the payroll of the Survey of Historical Records, his work
is done for the Writers and the results will make several national
volumes of folklore. The essays in the State Guides devoted to
folklore are also under his supervision.&quot; Since 1933 Mr. Lomax
has been Honorary Curator of the Archive of American Folk Song,
Library of Congress.
<br><br>
<a name='Footnote_2'></a><a href='#FNanchor_2'>[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Folklore
Consultant, from May 2 to July 31, 1938; Folklore
Editor, from August 1, 1938, to August 31, 1939.

<p>On August 31, 1939, the Federal Writers' Project became the
Writers' Program, and the National Technical Project in Washington
was terminated. On October 17, the first Library of Congress Project,
under the sponsorship of the Library of Congress, was set up
by the Work Projects Administration in the District of Columbia,
to continue some of the functions of the National Technical Project,
chiefly those concerned with books of a regional or nationwide
scope. On February 12, 1940, the project was reorganized
along strictly conservation lines, and on August 16 it was succeeded
by the present Library of Congress Project (Official Project
No. 165-2-26-7, Work Project No. 540).</p>

<p>The present Library of Congress Project, under the sponsorship
of the Library of Congress, is a unit of the Public Activities
Program of the Community Service Programs of the Work Projects
Administration for the District of Columbia. According
to the Project Proposal (WPA Form 301), the purpose of the Project
is to &quot;collect, check, edit, index, and otherwise prepare
for use WPA records, Professional and Service Projects.&quot;</p>

<p>The Writers' Unit of the Library of Congress Project processes
material left over from or not needed for publication by the
state Writers' Projects. On file in the Washington office in
August, 1939, was a large body of slave narratives, photographs
of former slaves, interviews with white informants regarding
slavery, transcripts of laws, advertisements, records of sale,
transfer, and manumission of slaves, and other documents. As unpublished
manuscripts of the Federal Writers' Project these
records passed into the hands of the Library of Congress Project
for processing; and from them has been assembled the present collection
of some two thousand narratives from the following seventeen
states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas,
Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and
Virginia<a name='FNanchor_3'></a><a href='#Footnote_3'>[1]</a>.</p>

<a name='Footnote_3'></a><a href='#FNanchor_3'>[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The
bulk of the Virginia narratives is still in the state office.
Excerpts from these are included in <u>The Negro in Virginia</u>,
compiled by Workers of the Writers' Program of the Work Projects
Administration in the State of Virginia, Sponsored by the Hampton
Institute, Hastings House, Publishers, New York, 1940. Other
slave narratives are published in <u>Drums and Shadows</u>, Survival
Studies among the Georgia Coastal Negroes, Savannah Unit, Georgia
Writers' Project, Work Projects Administration, University of
Georgia Press, 1940. A composite article, &quot;Slaves,&quot; based on excerpts
from three interviews, was contributed by Elizabeth Lomax
to the <u>American Stuff</u> issue of <u>Direction</u>, Vol. 1, No. 3, 1935.

<p>The work of the Writers' Unit in preparing the narratives for
deposit in the Library of Congress consisted principally of arranging
the manuscripts and photographs by states and alphabetically
by informants within the states, listing the informants and
illustrations, and collating the contents in seventeen volumes
divided into thirty-three parts. The following material has been
omitted: Most of the interviews with informants born too late to
remember anything of significance regarding slavery or concerned
chiefly with folklore; a few negligible fragments and unidentified
manuscripts; a group of Tennessee interviews showing evidence
of plagiarism; and the supplementary material gathered in connection
with the narratives. In the course of the preparation of
these volumes, the Writers' Unit compiled data for an essay on
the narratives and partially completed an index and a glossary.
Enough additional material is being received from the state Writers'
Projects, as part of their surplus, to make a supplement,
which, it is hoped, will contain several states not here represented,
such as Louisiana.</p>

<p>All editing had previously been done in the states or the
Washington office. Some of the pencilled comments have been
identified as those of John A. Lomax and Alan Lomax, who also
read the manuscripts. In a few cases, two drafts or versions
of the same interview have been included for comparison of interesting
variations or alterations.</p>
<br>

<b>II</b>

<p>Set beside the work of formal historians, social scientists,
and novelists, slave autobiographies, and contemporary records
of abolitionists and planters, these life histories, taken down
as far as possible in the narrators' words, constitute an invaluable
body of unconscious evidence or indirect source material,
which scholars and writers dealing with the South, especially
social psychologists and cultural anthropologists, cannot
afford to reckon without. For the first and the last time,
a large number of surviving slaves (many of whom have since
died) have been permitted to tell their own story, in their own
way. In spite of obvious limitations&mdash;bias and fallibility of
both informants and interviewers, the use of leading questions,
unskilled techniques, and insufficient controls and checks&mdash;this
saga must remain the most authentic and colorful source
of our knowledge of the lives and thoughts of thousands of slaves,
of their attitudes toward one another, toward their masters,
mistresses, and overseers, toward poor whites, North and South,
the Civil War, Emancipation, Reconstruction, religion, education,
and virtually every phase of Negro life in the South.</p>

<p>The narratives belong to folk history&mdash;history recovered from
the memories and lips of participants or eye-witnesses, who
mingle group with individual experience and both with observation,
hearsay, and tradition. Whether the narrators relate what they
actually saw and thought and felt, what they imagine, or what
they have thought and felt about slavery since, now we know <u>why</u>
they thought and felt as they did. To the white myth of slavery
must be added the slaves' own folklore and folk-say of slavery.
The patterns they reveal are folk and regional patterns&mdash;the patterns
of field hand, house and body servant, and artisan; the
patterns of kind and cruel master or mistress; the patterns of
Southeast and Southwest, lowland and upland, tidewater and inland,
smaller and larger plantations, and racial mixture (including Creole
and Indian).</p>

<p>The narratives belong also to folk literature. Rich not only
in folk songs, folk tales, and folk speech but also in folk humor
and poetry, crude or skilful in dialect, uneven in tone and
treatment, they constantly reward one with earthy imagery, salty
phrase, and sensitive detail. In their unconscious art, exhibited
in many a fine and powerful short story, they are a contribution
to the realistic writing of the Negro. Beneath all the
surface contradictions and exaggerations, the fantasy and flattery,
they possess an essential truth and humanity which surpasses
as it supplements history and literature.</p>

Subj: Folklore</h3>
<br>

<p>Dear Mrs. Richardson:</p>

<p>We have received from Florida a remarkably interesting
collection of autobiographical stories by ex-slaves. Such
documentary records by the survivors of a historic period in
America are invaluable, both to the student of history and to
creative writers.</p>

<p>If a volume of such importance can be assembled we
will endeavor to secure its publication. There undoubtedly
is material of this sort to be found in your State by making
the proper contact through tactful interviewers. While it is
desirable to give a running story of the life of each subject,
the color and human interest will be greatly enhanced if it is
told largely in the words of the person interviewed. The peculiar
idiom is often more expressive than a literary account.</p>

<p>We shall be very glad to know if you have undertaken
any research of this sort, or plan to do so.</p>

<p>Very truly yours,<br>
George Cronyn<br>
Associate Director<br>
Federal Writers' Project</p>

<h3>(Transcript of Preceding Autograph Memorandum)<br>

<br>

<p>Mr. Cronyn:</p>

<p>In replying to this letter I should like for you
to commend especially two stories:</p>

<p>1. <u>Lula Flannigan</u> by Sarah H. Hall Athens, Ga.</p>

<p>2. <u>Uncle Willis</u>, Miss Velma Bell, Supervisor, Athens, Ga.</p>

<p>All the stories are worth while but these two are mainly
(one entirely) in dialect and abound in human interest touches.
<u>All the interviewers should copy the Negro expressions</u>.</p>

<p>I much prefer to read <u>un</u>edited (but typed)
&quot;interviews,&quot; and I should like to see as soon as possible
all the seventy-five to which Miss Dillard refers.</p>

<p>It is most important, too, to secure copies of
&quot;slave codes, overseers codes and the like.&quot; This item is
new and all the states should send in similar material.</p>

<p>Yours,<br>

<br>

<p>Dear Mr. Bjorkman:</p>

<p>We have received more stories of ex-slaves and are
gratified by the quality and interest of the narratives.
Some of these stories have been accompanied by photographs
of the subjects. We would like to have portraits wherever
they can be secured, but we urge your photographers to
make the studies as simple, natural, and &quot;unposed&quot; as possible.
Let the background, cabin or whatnot, be the normal
setting&mdash;in short, just the picture a visitor would expect
to find by &quot;dropping in&quot; on one of these old-timers.</p>

<p>Enclosed is a memorandum of Mr. Lomax with suggestions
for simplifying the spelling of certain recurring dialect
words. This does not mean that the interviews should be entirely
in &quot;straight English&quot;&mdash;simply, that we want them to
be more readable to those uninitiated in the broadest Negro
speech.</p>

FOLKLORE<br>
STORIES FROM EX-SLAVES</h3>
<br>

<p>Note: In some states it may be possible to locate only
a very few ex-slaves, but an attempt should be
made in every state. Interesting ex-slave data
has recently been reported from Rhode Island, for
instance.</p>

<p>April 22, 1937</p>
<br>

<p><b>STORIES FROM EX-SLAVES</b></p>

<p>The main purpose of these detailed and homely questions
is to get the Negro interested in talking about the days of slavery.
If he will talk freely, he should be encouraged to say what he pleases
without reference to the questions. It should be remembered that the
Federal Writers' Project is not interested in taking sides on any
question. The worker should not censor any material collected, regardless
of its nature.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary, indeed it will probably be a mistake,
to ask every person all of the questions. Any incidents or facts
he can recall should be written down as nearly as possible just as he
says them, but do not use dialect spelling so complicated that it may
confuse the reader.</p>

<p>A second visit, a few days after the first one, is important,
so that the worker may gather all the worthwhile recollections that the
first talk has aroused.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Questions:</b></p>

<p>1. Where and when were you born?</p>

<p>2. Give the names of your father and mother. Where did they come

Plantation hollers? Can you tell a funny story you have heard or
something funny that happened to you? Tell about the ghosts you

<p>18. What do you think of Abraham Lincoln? Jefferson Davis?
Booker Washington? Any other prominent white man or Negro you have

<p>
The details of the interview should be reported as
accurately as possible in the language of the original statements.
An example of material collected through one of the
interviews with ex-slaves is attached herewith. Although this
material was collected before the standard questionnaire had
been prepared, it represents an excellent method of reporting
an interview. More information might have been obtained however,
if a comprehensive questionnaire had been used.</p>

Subj: Ex-slave Narratives</h3>
<br>

<p>Dear Mr. Bjorkman:</p>

<p>I am quoting a memorandum of Mr. Lomax, folklore
editor, regarding the ex-slave stories:</p>

<p>&quot;Of the five States which have already sent in reminiscences
of ex-slaves, Tennessee is the only one in which the
workers are asking ex-slaves about their belief in signs, cures,
hoodoo, etc. Also, the workers are requesting the ex-slaves
to tell the stories that were current among the Negroes when
they were growing up. Some of the best copy that has come in
to the office is found in these stories.&quot;</p>

<p>This suggestion, I believe, will add greatly to the
value of the collection now being made.</p>

<p>Very truly yours,<br>

<h3>MEMORANDUM<br>
June 9, 1937<br>
<br>
TO: STATE DIRECTORS OF THE FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT<br>
FROM: Henry G. Alsberg, Director</h3>
<br>

<p>In connection with the stories of ex-slaves, please
send in to this office copies of State, county, or city laws
affecting the conduct of slaves, free Negroes, overseers, patrollers,
or any person or custom affecting the institution of
slavery. It will, of course, not be necessary to send more
than one copy of the laws that were common throughout the state,
although any special law passed by a particular city would constitute
worthwhile material.</p>

<p>In addition, we should like to have you collect and
send in copies of any laws or accounts of any established customs
relating to the admission to your State of bodies of slaves
from Africa or other sections, the escape of slaves, etc. Also,
we should like to see copies of advertisements of sales of slaves,
published offers of rewards for fugitive slaves, copies of transfers
of slaves by will or otherwise, records of freeing of
slaves, etc. Public records of very particular interest regarding
any transaction involving slaves should be photostated and
copies furnished to the Washington office.</p>

<p>Furthermore, contemporary accounts of any noteworthy
occurrences among the Negroes during slavery days or the Reconstruction
period should be copied, if taken from contemporary
newspapers. If such records have been published in books, a
reference to the source would be sufficient. We have been receiving
a large number of extremely interesting stories of ex-slaves.
The historic background of the institution of slavery,
which should be disclosed with the information we are now
requesting, will be very helpful in the execution of the plans
we have in mind.</p>

<h3>Notes by an editor on dialect usage in accounts<br>
by interviews with ex-slaves. (To be used in<br>
conjunction with Supplementary Instructions 9E.)</h3>
<br>

<p>Simplicity in recording the dialect is to be desired in order
to hold the interest and attention of the readers. It seems to
me that readers are repelled by pages sprinkled with misspellings,
commas and apostrophes. The value of exact phonetic transcription is,
of course, a great one. But few artists attempt
this completely. Thomas Nelson Page was meticulous in his dialect;
Joel Chandler Harris less meticulous but in my opinion
even more accurate. But the values they sought are different
from the values that I believe this book of slave narratives
should have. Present day readers are less ready for the over-stress
of phonetic spelling than in the days of local color.
Authors realize this: Julia Peterkin uses a modified Gullah instead
of Gonzales' carefully spelled out Gullah. Howard Odum
has questioned the use of goin' for going since the g is seldom
pronounced even by the educated.</p>

<p>Truth to idiom is more important, I believe, than truth to
pronunciation. Erskine Caldwell in his stories of Georgia, Ruth
Suckow in stories of Iowa, and Nora Neale Hurston in stories of
Florida Negroes get a truth to the manner of speaking without
excessive misspellings. In order to make this volume of slave
narratives more appealing and less difficult for the average
reader, I recommend that truth to idiom be paramount, and exact
truth to pronunciation secondary.</p>

<p>I appreciate the fact that many of the writers have recorded
sensitively. The writer who wrote &quot;ret&quot; for right is probably
as accurate as the one who spelled it &quot;raght.&quot; But in a
single publication, not devoted to a study of local speech, the
reader may conceivably be puzzled by different spellings of the
same word. The words &quot;whafolks,&quot; &quot;whufolks,&quot; &quot;whi'foiks,&quot; etc.,
can all be heard in the South. But &quot;whitefolks&quot; is easier for
the reader, and the word itself is suggestive of the setting
and the attitude.</p>

<p>Words that definitely have a notably different pronunciation
from the usual should be recorded as heard. More important is
the recording of words with a different local meaning. Most
important, however, are the turns of phrase that have flavor
and vividness. Examples occurring in the copy I read are:</p>

durin' of de war<br>
outmen my daddy (good, but unnecessarily put into quotes)<br>
piddled in de fields<br>
skit of woods<br>
kinder chillish<br>

<p>There are, of course, questionable words, for which it may
be hard to set up a single standard. Such words are:</p>

paddyrollers, padrollers, pattyrollers   for patrollers<br>
missis, mistess                          for mistress<br>
marsa, massa, maussa, mastuh             for master<br>
ter, tuh, teh                            for to<br>

<p>I believe that there should be, for this book, a uniform
word for each of these.</p>

<p>The following list is composed of words which I think
should not be used. These are merely samples of certain faults:</p>

1. ah for I<br>
2. bawn for born<br>
3. capper for caper<br>
4. com' for come<br>
5. do for dough<br>
6. ebry, ev'ry for every<br>
7. hawd for hard<br>
8. muh for my<br>
9. nekid for naked<br>
10. ole, ol'       for       old<br>
11. ret, raght     for       right<br>
12. sneik          for       snake<br>
13. sowd           for       sword<br>
14. sto'           for       store<br>
15. teh            for       tell<br>
16. twon't         for       twan't<br>
17. useter, useta  for       used to<br>
18. uv             for       of<br>
19. waggin         for       wagon<br>
20. whi'           for       white<br>
21. wuz            for       was<br>

<p>I should like to recommend that the stories be told in the
language of the ex-slave, without excessive editorializing and
&quot;artistic&quot; introductions on the part of the interviewer. The contrast
between the directness of the ex-slave speech and the
roundabout and at times pompous comments of the interviewer is
frequently glaring. Care should be taken lest expressions such
as the following creep in: &quot;inflicting wounds from which he
never fully recovered&quot; (supposed to be spoken by an ex-slave).</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to recommend that the words darky and
nigger and such expressions as &quot;a comical little old black woman&quot;
be omitted from the editorial writing. Where the ex-slave himself
uses these, they should be retained.</p>

<h3>MEMORANDUM<br>
July 30, 1937.<br>
<br>
TO: STATE DIRECTORS OF THE FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT<br>
FROM: Henry G. Alsberg, Director</h3>
<br>

<p>The following general suggestions are being sent to
all the States where there are ex-slaves still living. They
will not apply <u>in toto</u> to your State as they represent general
conclusions reached after reading the mass of ex-slave material
already submitted. However, they will, I hope, prove helpful
as an indication, along broad lines, of what we want.</p>
<br>

<b>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS:</b>

<p>1. Instead of attempting to interview a large number
of ex-slaves the workers should now concentrate on one or two of
the more interesting and intelligent people, revisiting them,
establishing friendly relations, and drawing them out over a
period of time.</p>

<p>2. The specific questions suggested to be asked of
the slaves should be only a basis, a beginning. The talk should
run to all subjects, and the interviewer should take care to
sieze upon the information already given, and stories already
told, and from them derive other questions.</p>

<p>3. The interviewer should take the greatest care not
to influence the point of view of the informant, and not to let
his own opinion on the subject of slavery become obvious. Should
the ex-slave, however, give only one side of the picture, the
interviewer should suggest that there were other circumstances,
and ask questions about them.</p>

<p>4. We suggest that each state choose one or two of
their most successful ex-slave interviewers and have them take
down some stories <u>word</u> for <u>word</u>. Some Negro informants are marvellous
in their ability to participate in this type of interview.
<u>All stories should be as nearly word-for-word as is possible.</u></p>

<p>5. More emphasis should be laid on questions concerning
the lives of the individuals since they were freed.</p>
<br>

<b>SUGGESTIONS TO INTERVIEWERS:</b>

<p>The interviewer should attempt to weave the following
questions naturally into the conversation, in simple language.
Many of the interviews show that the workers have simply sprung
routine questions out of context, and received routine answers.</p>

<p>1. What did the ex-slaves expect from freedom? Forty
acres and a mule? A distribution of the land of their masters'
plantation?</p>

<p>2. What did the slaves get after freedom? Were any
of the plantations actually divided up? Did their masters give
them any money? Were they under any compulsion after the war to
remain as servants?</p>

<p>3. What did the slaves do after the war? What did
they receive generally? What do they think about the reconstruction
period?</p>

<p>4. Did secret organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan
exert or attempt to exert any influence over the lives of ex-slaves?</p>

<p>5. Did the ex-slaves ever vote? If so, under what circumstances?
Did any of their friends ever hold political office?
What do the ex-slaves think of the present restricted suffrage?</p>

<p>6. What have the ex-slaves been doing in the interim
between 1864 and 1937? What jobs have they held (in detail)?
How are they supported nowadays?</p>

<p>7. What do the ex-slaves think of the younger generation
of Negroes and of present conditions?</p>

<p>8. Were there any instances of slave uprisings?</p>

<p>9. Were any of the ex-slaves in your community living in
Virginia at the time of the Nat Turner rebellion? Do they remember
anything about it?</p>

<p>10. What songs were there of the period?</p>
<br>
<p>The above sent to: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Ga., Kentucky, La.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Md., Mississippi, Mo., N. Car., Okla., S. Car., Tenn., Texas, Virginia,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W. Va., Ohio, Kansas, Indiana.</p>

<h3>MEMORANDUM<br>
September 8, 1937<br>
<br>
TO: STATE DIRECTORS OF THE FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT<br>
FROM: HENRY G. ALSBERG</h3>
<br>

<p>It would be a good idea if you would ask such of your
field workers as are collecting stories from ex-slaves to try
to obtain stories given to the ex-slaves by their parents and
grandparents. The workers should try to obtain information
about family traditions and legends passed down from generation
to generation. There should be a wealth of such material available.</p>

<p>We have found that the most reliable way to obtain information
about the age of ex-slaves or the time certain events
in their lives took place is to ask them to try to recollect some
event of importance of known date and to use that as a point of
reference. For instance, Virginia had a very famous snow storm
called Cox's Snow Storm which is listed in history books by date
and which is well remembered by many ex-slaves. In Georgia and
Alabama some ex-slaves remember the falling stars of the year
1883. An ex-slave will often remember his life story in relation
to such events. Not only does it help the chronological accuracy
of ex-slave stories to ask for dated happenings of this kind, but
it often serves to show whether the story being told is real or
imagined.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
